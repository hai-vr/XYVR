- Hai:
    Hello, is there an official source that proves that https://api.vrchat.cloud is really the official endpoint that is supposed to be used by consumers of the API?
    I was trying to audit my own code, and it was using api.vrchat.cloud, and I could have sworn the official website UI used that back in December 2024, but it no longer appears to be the case?

    It's in a private server VRChat uses for them to communicate breaking changes to us.

    They wanted to segment traffic, the site uses vrchat.com/api, which has aggressive anti-bot Cloudflare rules applied to it.
    While api.vrchat.cloud has the self identification user agent rule applied, & other rate limits.
